This repository presents preliminary results from our initial work on PCB counterfeit detection, IC layer identification, and segmentation.
For PCB counterfeit detection, we employ convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification, with the Inception-V3 architecture achieving a classification accuracy of 99.14%.
IC layer identification is performed using FIB technology to distinguish the seven metal layers in an in-house designed PUF IC, while component identification is carried out through GDSII equivalence checking.
Our IC layer segmentation approach utilizes a Swin-Transformer-based GAN architecture to effectively segment metal traces and vias from SEM images.
